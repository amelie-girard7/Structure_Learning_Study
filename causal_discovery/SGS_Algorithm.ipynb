    "This notebook constitutes a comprehensive exploration of the Spirtes-Glymour-Scheines (SGS) algorithm, a cornerstone of causal discovery from observational data. This repository will provide you with a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing the SGS algorithm in Python. We start by introducing the basic definition and the original description of the algorithm as presented in the seminal book  <i>\"Causation, Prediction, and Search\"</i> by Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines. We then delve into the complexity and stability analysis of the SGS algorithm, providing insights into its computational efficiency and robustness to minor input perturbations. The discussion further expands to the consequences of violating the causal assumptions that underpin the SGS algorithm. In the implementation details section, you'll find a practical Python implementation of the SGS algorithm, and finally, an example of its execution on a sample dataset. Whether you're a student, researcher, or data science professional, this repository aims to be a valuable resource for understanding and applying the SGS algorithm in your causal inference journey.\n",

The reason for this is a fundamental property of conditional independence: two variables can be dependent given one set of variables, but independent given a different set (whether it's a subset or a superset). This means that to reliably determine whether two variables are conditionally independent, we need to check all possible subsets of the other variables.
